Jumping off point for Cisco's backend Forage program

During your walk, Erik says that he’d like to find a way to streamline the work of a field technician. Currently, he has to use a range of different tools tools to collect basic networking information from the computers he works on.

That’s when an idea hits you! You suggest that you could change this by building some kind of dashboard…

Erik thinks it’s a dashboard is an awesome idea and begins rattling off a laundry list of things he’d like it to be capable of. You take frantic notes, trying to capture the flood of information. Then the two of you dash back to the office.

Not fifteen minutes later, you’re pitching the idea to Garett. He smiles, nods, and says he’ll see what he can do…

A few days later you receive word that development is to begin on the dashboard immediately. Apparently the higher-ups your project manager talked to loved the idea. The project, termed Sextant, will be a dashboard used by field technicians to get a high level overview of the systems they work on.

Field technicians are responsible for deploying and troubleshooting networking hardware. As such, the dashboard will be full of all sorts of networking information, presented in a concise and easy to understand format.

Given that it was your idea, you’ve been tasked with developing the frontend. The first step will be to get an MVP (minimum viable product) up and running so the field technicians can play with it and give some feedback.

After talking to a number of these technicians, your team has determined that the IP and latency metrics are a top priority. The next step is to come up with a website that can display them. Time to get to work…
